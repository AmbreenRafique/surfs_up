##summary

by analysing the weather data i conclude that the weather condition of the island is overall good for opening a 'surf and shake' shop. we can see few high peaks of precipitaion and a small percentage of dates with low temprature but most of the days are suitable for both surfing and having ice cream with temprature between 75F_85F.

USC00519281, USC00519397, USC00513117 are the 3 most active stations and would be better to choose a station among these to open the shop.

Tempratures in December are comparitivly lower than June but there is no major difference in minmium and maximum tempratures of both months.
