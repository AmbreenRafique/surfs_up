# SURFS_UP

## Overview

we have to analyse weather data of Oahu. The purpose of analysing data is to help the client in making a decision about opening a "Surf and Shake" shop to serve locals and tourists.

By analysing the general weather conditions of the island and the level of precipitaton of previous years can give us a fair idea of how successful the business of opening a "surf and shake(ice cream)"shop would be. Moreover, we will analyze the active stations to determine best place to open the shop.

## Results

Analysed the data of previous year (last 365 days) and the summary statistics are as follows:

## Summary

By analysing the weather data I conclude that the weather condition of the island is overall good for opening a 'surf and shake' shop. We can see few high peaks of precipitaion and a small percentage of dates with low temprature but most of the days are suitable for both surfing and having ice cream with temprature between 75F-85F.

USC00519281, USC00519397, USC00513117 are the 3 most active stations and would be better to choose a station among these to open the shop.

Tempratures in December are comparatively lower than June but there is no major difference in minmium and maximum tempratures of both months.
